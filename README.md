# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This project aims to develop a breast cancer prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether the cancer in a person is benign or malignant based on a set of input features.

# Introduction

Breast Cancer is one of the most deadliest disease worldwide. Early detection and prediction of breast cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms and predict the likelihood of breast cancer.

# Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kyofie/Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Navigate to the project directory: cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction

# Data

The heart disease prediction model requires a labeled dataset for training. The dataset should contain records of individuals along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Prepare your input data in a CSV file with appropriate columns and values.
Update the file path in the code to point to your input data.
The data is understood using correlation matrix, hsitograms and bar plot.

A sample dataset is provided (data.csv). 

# Model Development

The heart disease prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, such as K Neighbors Classifier, Logistic regression and random forest classifier.
